* Bits
A small Racket library to treat a =Bytes= object as a 2D matrix of bits, with
a width of 8. This allows for convenient, index-based reading and writing of
individual bits within a byte vector.

* Installation
You can install it using =raco=:

#+begin_src shell
raco pkg install bits
#+end_src
